                                    Two of the leading causes of heart disease and stroke are high blood pressure and
                                    high
                                    blood
                                    cholesterol. Consuming too much sodium can increase blood pressure and the risk for
                                    heart
                                    disease
                                    and stroke. Current guidelines recommend getting less than 2,300 mg a day, but
                                    Americans
                                    consume
                                    more than 3,400 mg a day on average.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Over 70% of the sodium that Americans eat comes from packaged, processed,
                                    store-bought,
                                    and
                                    restaurant foods. Eating foods low in saturated fats and high in fiber and

                                    low-sodium foods, along with regular physical activity, can help prevent high blood

                                    and
                                    high blood pressure.</p>

                                    Choose healthy meal and snack
                                    options to help you avoid high blood pressure and its
                                    complications.
                                    Be sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.
                                    Talk with your health care team about eating a variety of foods rich in potassium,
                                    fiber,
                                    and

                                    healthy
                                    changes
                                    can help keep blood pressure low and protect against heart disease and stroke.

                                    Most of the sodium we consume is in the form of salt, and the vast majority of
                                    sodium we
                                    consume
                                    is
                                    in processed and restaurant foods. Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work
                                    properly,
                                    but
                                    too much sodium is bad for your health.
                                    Excess sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for heart disease and
                                    stroke.
                                    Together,
                                    heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause.

                                <p>A diabetes diet is based on eating three meals a day at regular times. This helps you
                                    better
                                    use
                                    the
                                    insulin that your body produces or gets through a medication.
                                    A registered dietitian can help you put together a diet based on your health goals,
                                    tastes
                                    and

                                    such as
                                    choosing portion sizes that suit the needs for your size and activity level.
                                    Recommended foods
                                    Make your calories count with these nutritious foods. Choose healthy carbohydrates,

                                    foods, fish and "good" fats.

                                    Breast milk is the optimal nutrient mix for infants. It’s full of good stuff like

                                    Breastfeeding keeps the baby developing and growing properly, helps infants fight

                                    Because breastfeeding stimulates the release of beneficial hormones such as oxytocin
                                    and
                                    prolactin,

                                    Breast milk is delivered in a biodegradable “organic package”, so mom doesn’t need

                                    your baby during the first 12 months is whole cow's
                                    milk. It
                                    doesn't have enough iron, vitamin E, and essential fatty acids for your baby. Also,
                                    it contains too much protein, sodium, and potassium for your child's body to absorb
                                    and can cause harm. Wait to introduce cow's milk until your baby is 1-year-old.</p>
                                <p>Another thing to not give your baby is whole nuts and peanuts shouldn't be given to
                                    children under 5 years old, as they can choke on them.

                                    You can give your baby nuts and peanuts from around 6 months old, as long as they're
                                    crushed, ground or a smooth nut or peanut butter.

                                    If there's a history of food allergies or other allergies in your family, talk to
                                    your GP or health visitor before introducing nuts and peanuts.</p>

                                <h5>Protein </h5>
                                <p>gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and
                                    cognitive function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease,
                                    but
                                    the
                                    latest
                                    research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we
                                    age.
                                    That
                                    doesn’t
                                    mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based sources of
                                    protein
                                    each
                                    day
                                    can
                                    ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs.</p>

                                <h5>Fat </h5>
                                <p>Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of
                                    certain
                                    diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. In fact, healthy fats—such as
                                    omega-3s—are
                                    vital
                                    to your physical and emotional health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can
                                    help
                                    improve
                                    your
                                    mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline.</p>


                                <h5>Fiber</h5>
                                <p>Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can
                                    help
                                    you
                                    stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can
                                    also
                                    improve
                                    your
                                    skin and even help you to lose weight.</p>

                                <h5> Calcium</h5>
                                <p>As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also
                                    contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or
                                    gender,
                                    it’s
                                    vital
                                    to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and
                                    get
                                    enough
                                    magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.</p>

                                <h5>Carbohydrates</h5>
                                <p>are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should come from complex,
                                    unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined
                                    carbs.
                                    Cutting
                                    back
                                    on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood
                                    sugar,
                                    fluctuations
                                    in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline.

                                    Avoid eating late at night. Try to eat dinner earlier and fast for 14-16 hours until

                                <h5>Why the time of day makes a difference</h5>
                                <p> Our bodies become more insulin resistant throughout the day.
                                    This means sugar stays in your bloodstream and is transformed into fat. That’s why,
                                    he says, it’s best to avoid eating after dark.

                                    In fact, he recommends eating 75 percent of our daily calories before 2 p.m., with
                                    breakfast and lunch being our largest meals, and dinner the smallest. Before long,
                                    it will become habit.
